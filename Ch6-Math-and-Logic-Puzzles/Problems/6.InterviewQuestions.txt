6.1 The Heavy Pill:
Hints:
186, 252, 319, 387
Problem:
- 20 bottles of pills
- 19 bottles have 1.0 g pills
- 1 bottle has 1.1 g pills
- scale, how to find heavy bottle
- use only once
Solution:
- 1 pill, 2 pill, 3 pill... plus 1 for every bottle to number them
- different number of pill for every bottle
- the .n will tell us which bottle
- so at least 1+2+...+20 = (20*21)/2 = 210g
- (weight - 210g) / 0.1 g.
- 211.3 g means Bottle #13 would have the heavy pills

6.2 Basketball:
Hints:
181, 239, 284, 323
Problem:
- one hoop, 2 games
- Game 1: get one shot to make the hoop
- Game 2: get 3 shots and you have to make 2/3 shots
- p is probability of making a particular shot
- for which values of p should you pick one game or the other
Solution:
- P(G1) = p
- s(k,n) is probability of making k shots out of n
- P(G2) = s(2,3) + s(3,3)
- s(3,3) = p*p*p = p^3
- s(2,3) = P(1,2,X) + P(1,X,3) + P(X,2,3)
- 	 = 3*(p * p * (1-p))
- 	 = 3(1-p)p^2
- p^3 + 3(1-p)p^2 = p^3 + 3p^2 - 3p^3
- = 3p^2 - 2p^3
- Play Game 1 if P(G1) > P(G2)
- p > 3p^2 - 2p^3
- 1 > 3p - 2p^2
- 2p^2 - 3p + 1 > 0
- (2p-1)(p-1) > 0
- Both are negative hence
- 2p-1 < 0
- 2p < 1
- p < 0.5
- Play G1 if 0 < p < 0.5
- Play G2 if 0.5 < p < 1
- if 0, 0.5 or 1, then P(G1) = P(G2)

6.3 Dominos:
Hints:
181, 239, 284, 323
Problem:
- 8x8 chessboard
- two diagnally opposite corners cut off
- 31 dominos, single domino cover exactly 2 squares
- use 31 dominos to cover the entire board
- 
Solutions:
- Impossible
- the two diagonal pieces will always be of same color
- 32 black 32 white -> 30 black 32 white
- a domino will always cover 1 black and 1 white
- 31 dominos will cover 31 black and 31 white
- however we must cover 30 black and 32 white
- hence impossible

6.4 Ants on a Triangle:
Hints:
157, 195, 296
Problem:
- 3 ants on different vertices of triangle
- probability of collision (between any two or all)
- start walking on the sides of the triangle
- ant randomly picks direction, equally likely, same speed
- probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon
Solution:
Triangle:
P(clock) = (1/2)^3
P(counter) = (1/2)^3
P(same dir) = (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^3 = 1/4
P(collision) = 1 - P(same dir) = 3/4
n-vertex polygon:
P(clock) = (1/2)^n
P(counter) = (1/2)^n
P(same dir) = (1/2)^n + (1/2)^n = 2(1/2)^n = (1/2)^(n-1)
P(collision) = 1 - P(same dir) = 1 - (1/2)^(n-1)

6.5 Jugs of Water:
Hints:
149, 379, 400
Problem:
- 5 quart jug, 3 quart jug, unlimited supply of water
- come up with exactly 4 quarts of water
Solution:
- fill 5 quart first, pour from 5 to 3 so you get 2 in 5
- throw out water in 3, and pour the 2 in 5 to 3
- now fill 5, and pour enough to fill 2 to 3 in 3
- now 5 has 4 quarts of water
5 Quart	3 Quart
5	0
2	3
2	0
0	2
5	2
4	3
4

6.6 Blue-Eyed Island:
Hints:
218, 282, 341, 370
Problem:
- bunch of people live on island
- visitor orders all blue-eyed people must leave island
- flight ot at 8:00 pm every evening
- each person can see everyone else's eye color, but not their own
- do not know how many people have blue eyes, at least one person does
- how many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave
Solution:
- 1 day
- n people, c blue
- Case c = 1: 1 person sees no blue eyes, means he is blue eye since c > 0
- Case c = 2: both stay first night to see if the other leaves
- if the other is still there second night it means both have to leave
- Case c > 2: if c men have blue eyes, it will take c nights for blue eyed men to leave

6.7 The Apocolypse:
Hints:
154, 160, 171, 188, 201
Problem:
- world queen is concerned about birth rate
- decrees that all families should ensure they have 1 girl or face massive fines
- if all families abide, continue to have children until 1 girl
- what will gender ratio of new generation be
Solution:
- the ratio will still be 50:50
- the odds not changed, even though we stop having boy once we reach girl

6.8 The Egg Drop Problem:
Hints:
156, 233, 294, 333, 357, 374, 395
Problem:
- Building of 100 floors
- If egg drops from Nth floor or above, it will break
- If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break
- Given 2 eggs, find N, minimizing the number of drops
Solution:
- Egg 1 gets dropped 14, 13, 12... til 4, if we encounter break, then use egg2 to determine exact by
- incrementing one floor at at time from previous floor
- this makes it so that the number of drops is minimized, because egg2 will at most be dropped the same amount of time as egg1

6.9 100 Lockers:
Hints:
139, 172, 264, 306
Problem:
- 100 closed lockers in a hallway
- 1st pass, opens all 100 lockers
- 2nd pass, closes every second locker
- 3rd pass, toggles every third locker (opposite)
- continues for 100 passes
- for each i, man toggles every ith locker
- after 100th pass, he toggles only locker 100, how many lockers are open?
Solution: 
- realize that doors are left open only if number of factors is odd
- numbers of factors is odd for perfect squares, which there are 10
- hence 10 lockers will be left open

6.10 Poison:
Hints:
146, 163, 183, 191, 205, 221, 230, 241, 249
Problem:
- 1000 bottles of soda, 1 is poisoned
- 10 test strips to detect poison
- Single drop of poison will turn test strip positive permanently
- put any number of drops on test strip at once
- reuse a test strip as many times as you'd like
- run tests once per day
- takes 7 days to return result
- figure out the poisoned bottel in as few days as possible?
Solution:
- Use the strips as binary representation of the bottles numbers
- 10 strips means it can represent/store upto 1024 bits/numbers
